COVID-19 Target product profile:2

Overview:

Community use for COVID-19 patients and preventative cover for health workers / high risk individuals, assume age profile mainly 18-80, gender balanced, medium proportion with co-morbidities.
All figures currently estimates to be improved on experimental data.

What					Target							Why

enzyme assay				IC50 <10nM						extrapolation from other anti-viral programs
Viral Entry assay			TBC
Plaque reduction assay			TBC
Spectrum				cover > 95% of clinical isolates at IC50 TBC	
Mutant cover				unknown							what are common / accessible mutant isoforms?
other COV forms 			unknown, discuss, separate TPP?				move to separate project to look at COVID-X looking for pan COVID inhibitors

Route of administration			oral
solubility				>=1mg/ml						biopharmaceutical class 1 assuming =<250mg dose
t1/2					>=8h (human) estimated from rat & dog			assume PK/PD requires continuous cover over plaque inhibition for 24h max bid dosing

Safety					Reversible and monitorable toxicities			Normal usage
					No significant DDI - clean in 5 CYP-450 isoforms	General adult patient group with with potential for multiple other therapies
					hERG and NaV1.5 IC50 > 50uM				Cardiac stress significant in COVID-19				
					No significant change in QTc
					No mutagenicity or teratogenicity risk			Patient group will include significant proportion of women of child bearing age.
