COVID-19 Target product profile:1

Overview:

Hospital IV treatment for critical care COVID-19 patients, assume age profile mainly >50, gender balanced, high proportion with co-morbidities.
All figures currently estimates to be improved on experimental data.

What					Target							Why

enzyme assay				IC50 <10nM						extrapolation from other anti-viral programs
Viral Entry assay			TBC
Plaque reduction assay			TBC
Spectrum				cover > 95% of clinical isolates at IC50 TBC	
Mutant cover				unknown							what are common / accessible mutant isoforms
other COV forms 			unknown, discuss, separate TPP?				move to separate project to look at COVID-X looking for pan COVID inhibitors

Route of administration			IV infusion
solubility				>10mg/ml at pH >5					limit for IV infusion
t1/2					>=6h (human) estimated from rat & dog			assume PK/PD requires continuous cover over plaque inhibition for 24h max tid dosing

Safety					Reversible and monitorable toxicities			Normal usage
					No significant DDI - clean in 5 CYP _450 isoforms	Predominantly geriatric patient group with co-morbidities and multiple therapies
					hERG and NaV1.5 IC50 > 50uM				Cardiac stress significant in COVID-19				
					No significant change in QTc
